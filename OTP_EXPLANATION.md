# 🔑 OTP Verification Options Explained

## What are Tokens?

**Tokens** are like passwords that let your app send SMS messages. Think of them as "access cards" for SMS services.

## 💰 Cost Comparison

| Method | Cost | Setup Required |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **Email OTP** | 🆓 FREE | ✅ Ready to use |
| **SMS OTP** | 💰 $0.0075+ per SMS | ⚙️ Needs SMS provider setup |

## 🆓 **RECOMMENDED: Email OTP (FREE)**

**Why Email OTP is better:**
- ✅ **Completely FREE** - No tokens needed
- ✅ **Works immediately** - No setup required
- ✅ **Reliable** - Email delivery is more reliable than SMS

**How it works:**
1. User enters email, password, full name, phone number
2. App sends OTP to email address
3. User enters the 6-digit code from email
4. Account is created successfully

## 📱 **SMS OTP (Requires Setup)**

**What you need:**
- **SMS Provider Account** (Twilio, MessageBird, etc.)

**Setup Steps:**

4. Pay for each SMS sent

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

Try the **Email OTP** option first - it will work right away without any tokens or setup!

## 🔧 **If you still want SMS**

If you really want SMS OTP, you'll need to:
1. Sign up for Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/)
2. Get your Account SID and Auth Token
3. Configure in Supabase dashboard
4. Pay ~$0.0075 per SMS
