## ‚úÖ Good Examples

### **Feature Additions**
```
feat(nutrition): implement FNRI nutrition calculation service
feat(ui): add scroll-based navigation transparency

feat(recipe): add user feedback and rating system
```

### **Bug Fixes**
```
fix(nutrition): resolve inaccurate protein calculation for Lumpia Shanghai
fix(ui): correct profile screen spacing issues
fix(api): handle missing nutrition data gracefully

```

### **Documentation**
```

```

### **Code Improvements**
```
refactor(nutrition): optimize ingredient quantity estimation
refactor(ui): simplify meal planner screen logic

```

### **Performance & Testing**
```
perf(nutrition): implement local CSV caching for faster calculations
test(nutrition): add comprehensive FNRI service tests
test(ui): add widget tests for recipe screens
perf(ui): optimize image loading and caching
```

## ‚ùå Bad Examples

### **Vague Descriptions**
```
fix: stuff
update: things
change: something
fix bug
```

### **Unprofessional Language**
```
fix: stupid bug that was annoying
update: crap that was broken
fix: everything that was wrong
```

### **Incomplete Information**
```
fix
update
change
```

### **Too Long Descriptions**
```
fix(nutrition): resolve the complex issue where the nutrition calculation was producing unrealistic values like 80+ grams of protein for simple dishes like Lumpia Shanghai which was caused by corrupted FNRI data and poor ingredient matching
```

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### **1. Before Committing**
- Review your changes thoroughly
- Ensure the commit represents a single logical change
- Test that your changes work as expected
- Consider if the change needs to be split into multiple commits

### **2. Writing the Message**
- Start with the type and scope
- Write a clear, action-oriented description
- Use present tense and imperative mood
- Keep it concise but descriptive

### **3. Commit Body (When Needed)**
- Use for complex changes that need explanation
- Explain the "why" not the "what"
- Reference related issues or discussions
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

### **4. Commit Footer (When Needed)**
- Reference related issues: `Closes #123`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`
- Co-authored commits: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`

## üìã Commit Message Templates

```

## üé® Special Cases

### **Breaking Changes**
```
feat(api)!: change nutrition calculation response format

BREAKING CHANGE: The nutrition calculation API now returns
nutrition data in a different structure. Update your client
code to handle the new format.

Migration guide: [link to migration docs]
```

### **Revert Commits**
```
revert: feat(nutrition): implement FNRI nutrition calculation service

This reverts commit [commit-hash] due to [reason].
```
